<b>Ebento</b> (japanese: イベント - Ibento) is event management and discovery platform designed to connect people with experiences that matter to them. 
Users can easily browse through a wide variety of events, from conferences and workshops to concerts and meetups and submit 
participation requests for the ones they’re interested in. For organizations and event hosts, Ebento provides a convenient space
to create, publish, and manage their events efficiently. They can track participation requests, update event details, and engage 
directly with attendees, all in one place.

The project is open-source, ensuring transparency and collaboration within the developer community. You can explore and test all 
available API endpoints through the Swagger documentation at the /docs path.

General tech stack (only backend for now): Spring Boot, PostgreSQL and Redis
